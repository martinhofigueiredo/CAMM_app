## Installation

1. Install ffmpeg and add to path to unsure its available to the application

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg

   Use python 3.11.9 or 3.12.3 for the environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# or
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install necessary requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the `server.py`

```bash
python server.py
```

## Configuration

The configuration file `config.toml` shows all the available parameters
